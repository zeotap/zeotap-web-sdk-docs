# Setting User Properties

The `window.zeotap.setUserProperties()` function allows you to send specific user attributes to Zeotap as a dedicated event named `set_user_properties`. This is useful for capturing and transmitting user-level information that might not be directly tied to a specific page view or action, but is still valuable for understanding the user.

:::note PII Behaviour
PIIs (like `cellno`, `email`, `loginid`) sent via `setUserProperties` are always hashed by the SDK before being sent to the backend. This behavior is similar to [Scenario 3. SDK Perform Hashing](./setUserIdentities/#sdk-performs-hashing) of the `setUserIdentities` function.
:::

**Key Characteristics:**

*   **Immediate Event:** Calling `setUserProperties` immediately triggers an event with the name `set_user_properties`.
*   **Non-Persistent:** The properties sent via this method are associated with this specific `set_user_properties` event. They are **not** automatically persisted in the browser's local storage or cookies by the SDK, nor are they automatically included with subsequent, different events (like page views or custom events triggered by `setEventProperties`).
*   **Distinct from [`setUserIdentities`](./setUserIdentities):** This function is different from `setUserIdentities`, which is used for establishing and persisting core user identifiers. `setUserProperties` is for sending additional, often more dynamic or contextual, user-level attributes.

**Parameters**

*   `properties` (Object): An object containing key-value pairs representing the user properties.
    *   Keys should be strings.
    *   Values can be strings, numbers, or booleans.

**Usage Example**

```javascript title="Sending user segment and a custom preference"

window.zeotap.setUserProperties({
  userSegment: 'loyal_customer',
  communicationPreference: 'email_only',
  lastPurchaseCategory: 'electronics',
  email: 'user@example.com'
});
```

To verify that user property setting is working:

1. Open your browser's **Developer Tools** (`F12` or right-click â†’ *Inspect*).
2. Go to the **Network** tab.
3. Trigger a page view in your application.
4. Look for a network `POST` request sent to ```https://spl.zeotap.com/fp?```.
5. Check for the request with `eventName`: `set_user_properties`.
6. The payload should contain a `user` object with the key-value pairs you passed to `setUserProperties`.
7. After the `setUserProperties` call, trigger a different event (e.g., using `setEventProperties('another_event', { some_data: 'value' })`).
8. Inspect the network request for this new event.
9. Verify that the properties sent via `setUserProperties` are *not* present in the payload of this subsequent event, confirming their non-persistent nature for other event types.


# Use Cases

*   **Capturing User Preferences:** Sending user-defined preferences like "newsletter_opt_in: true" or "preferred_language: 'en'".
*   **Demographic Information:** Transmitting demographic data like "age_group: '25-34'" or "gender: 'female'" if collected with consent.
*   **User Segmentation Data:** Sending segment information derived from your system, e.g., "customer_tier: 'Gold'".
*   **Profile Updates:** Updating specific attributes about a user that are not core identifiers.


# setUserProperties vs setUserIdentities
| Feature | setUserProperties | setUserIdentities | 
|---|---|---|
| Triggers Event? | Yes, immediately (set_user_properties event) | No, updates internal state |
| Persistence | Not persisted in browser storage | Persisted in browser storage (session/local/cookie) |
| Event Association | Sent with its own `set_user_properties` event | Sent with all subsequent events until cleared/updated |
| Primary Use | Sending specific, non-persistent user attributes | Establishing and maintaining stable user identifiers |
